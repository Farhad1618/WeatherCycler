# WeatherCycler

WeatherCycler is a QML-based weather widget designed to showcase smooth transitions between three weather states: Clear, Frosty, and Hot. This project implements the following features:
	•	Interactive Transitions: Clicking the sun or moon cycles through the weather states while animations ensure smooth transitions between positions.
	•	Automatic Weather Cycling: Weather states rotate automatically, simulating a seamless experience.
	•	Animated Hills: Gentle animations add subtle movement to the hills for a dynamic and engaging UI.
	•	Live Time and Date: Displays the current time and day at the bottom-right corner.

Code Highlights

	1.	Simple and Concise Structure: The code is structured for clarity, ensuring functionality without excessive complexity. For larger real-world applications, adopting an architecture like MVVM could improve scalability and maintainability.
	2.	Animations: Smooth animations were added to the sun/moon transitions, hills, and background to enhance the user experience.

Notes

	•	The gentle animations on the hills were implemented as a subtle movement effect, aligning with the feedback provided.
	•	The structure prioritizes simplicity and readability, as requested, but could be optimized further with architectural patterns for complex projects.
